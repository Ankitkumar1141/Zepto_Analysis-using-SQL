# Zepto Dataset SQL Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **data analysis using SQL** on the **Zepto dataset** available on **Kaggle**. The goal is to explore, clean, and extract meaningful insights from the dataset by applying core and intermediate SQL concepts.

The analysis demonstrates practical usage of SQL for real-world datasets and showcases my understanding of querying, filtering, and aggregating data efficiently.

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Dataset Name:** Zepto Dataset
- The dataset contains information related to products, pricing, categories, and other attributes relevant for analysis.

## 🛠 SQL Concepts Used
The following SQL operations and concepts have been used extensively in this project:

- `SELECT`
- `WHERE`
- Aggregate Functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
- Filtering conditions
- `GROUP BY`
- `HAVING`
- Subqueries
- `CASE` statements
- `ORDER BY`
- `LIMIT`

These concepts are applied to answer analytical questions and derive insights from the dataset.
